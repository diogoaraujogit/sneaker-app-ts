# Sneakers e-commerce

 Simple checkout process of an e-commerce application in which the user will be able to buy one single product and pay using Trustly as the payment method.

## Tecnical Decisions
In order to keep it simple, I chose not to include tests and other similar verification tools.
Keeping in mind project's nature and objective, not enough user tests were run, therefore, app may includes some UI or usability minor bugs.
